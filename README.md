First Java programs

### 3/17 campusEventTicketing package: Inheritance & Abstract class
Ticket.java represents an abstract class for a generic ticket that is implemented with the ticket subclasses WalkupTicket, AdvanceTicket with subclass StudentAdvanceTicket. 

TicketingMain.java runs a simple test of the classes with polymorphic code that outputs the respective toString() calls to the console.

### 3/09 ch8 product_example: Product class
ProductMain.java runs tests instantializing objects from the Product.java class and outputs the Product object data to the console, formatted with the Product.toString() method.

### 3/01 ch7_arrays: SortedArray & UniqueArray
SortedArray.java tests the method isSorted() that accepts an array of real numbers as a parameter and outputs true if the arrat values are sorted (nondecreasing) in order, or false otherwise.
UniqueArray.java tests a method called isUnique() that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and outputs a boolean value indicating whether or not the values in the array are unique (true if yes, otherwise false).

### 2/24 AntCraw & PowerOfTwo
AntCraw.java is a simple program that simulates an ant trying to crawl up a building with a height of 6 steps. The ant has a 50/50 chance of slipping and falling back to bottom. The output is the number of attempts it took for the ant to reach the top
PowerOfTwo.java Example of a method powOfTwo that takes an int n as a parameter and returns a boolean value based on if n is a power of 2. If yes, then the test returns true, otherwise false is returned. 

### 2/21/20 ReadBoyGirl
(From Building Java Programs p439 ex 1)
ReadBoyGirl.java contains a method that accepts a Scanner object as a parameter and reads input from a file containing a series of name/integer pairs starting with a boy name/number and the name/number pairs alternate between boy & girl. The method outputs the respective counts of boys and girls and the absolute difference between the boy numbers & girl numbers.

### 2/18/20 Season & CalcGPA
(From Building Java Programs chpt 4 ex. 3 & 10)
Season.java contains a method that is passed two integers (hard coded) for the month and day respectively and uses nested if/else statments to output the corresponsing season.

CalcGPA.java is a simple program that accepts user input of a student grade record and outputs the calculated GPA.

### 2/01/20 repl Method
(From Building Java Programs chpt 4 ex. 2)
Example of a method that accepts a String and a number of repetitions as parameters and then outputs a concatenated repeated String. 

### 1/25 PowersofN Class
Example of a static method printPowersOfN that takes two arguments for the base number and exponent. The method runs a for loop to output each power-of value starting at 0 up to the exponent value entered in method call.

### 01/19/20 initial and first commit:
A simple program using a for loop to output the first 12 Fibonacci numbers to the console
